`todo`

## How to run

This project needs a config file called `config.yaml` at the root of this directory.

Copy the `config.yaml.dist` file:

```
cp config.yaml.dist config.yaml
```

Then edit it, to correctly set the pin number to which the motor is plugged to.

When you are done, run:

```
python door.py
```
